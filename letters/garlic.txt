Hi!

Merry Christmas! I’m really happy we’re friends - you actually have no idea. Last year I was a dick, and for some reason you stuck to it. I’m really happy you did, because you’re easily my best friend now, and I think it’s a given that I enjoy being with you 99% of the time. I’m really happy we sat next to each other. 

Hopefully I’m better now, and you can actually say the same thing about me - although I probably still need to fix some stuff. 

Anyway, have a merry christmas! This year was a lot of fun (end of junior, beginning of senior minus college apps) and next year will be even better - just think of everything we’ll do once apps are over and school is… finished, basically. And, I now have a license, so there’s the male driving representation?

Merry Christmas!
