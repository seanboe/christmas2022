Hi Keiji,

Since your creepy email, we've spoken quite a bit - more than my average discord stranger conversation - and you've gone from some random mit dude online, 
to the guy who had one of his balls removed, to the guy interning at mujin, to the pitiful chassis team member, to the consistent catan loser, to a great friend. 
I always enjoy talking to you to feel better about my roasts and hearing about your sometimes extreme (but usually based) takes. I agree with a lot of them. Hopefully 
next year will be filled with just as much sarcasm and bitchiness (from both sides :D ). Also - I'm always down to chat. Just call me! (Also, listen to the music carefully - I specifically chose it for you)
