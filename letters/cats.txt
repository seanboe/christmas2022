Merry Christmas!

I’m actually really happy to be friends with you - if we’re friends. Maybe you’re still big sis? Who knows?

I know I’ve told you this, although it was probably seen in the context of a joke, but in middle school I actually didn’t like you, and at the beginning of high school, I really didn’t you. And I was really in awe (and kind of jealous) that you took calc freshman year.

I can’t believe how wrong I was! You’re really nice, funny, quiet (which is probably a good influence on me) and I’m really happy to be your friend, or at least, to be on good terms with you? I can’t believe that Ben dragged me into you and Annabelle, and then Annabelle sorta dragged me into you - and I’m indebted to Annabelle going to Sees, since then we wouldn’t have salad spinner.

College is going to be a lot of fun, and I look forward to having a friend going there with me!

So have a Merry Christmas!

PS:
