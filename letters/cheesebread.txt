Merry Christmas Coach Jack! Thank you for the support you've given me (and the team) throughout the RobotX competition - it's really meant a lot. 
You've provided a wealth of knowledge alongside your vast, seemingly endless, pantry of tools and parts. Of course, your jokes and cheese bread 
make it even better! Thank you so much, and I'm excited to tackle the Robosub competition with you as a mentor again!
