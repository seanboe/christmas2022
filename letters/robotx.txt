Hi Coach Alex! I just want to thank you for allowing me to join Team Inspiration and providing support throughout the season. Prior 
to joining the team, I had a fairly poor perception of most robotics teams - the one at school is unmotivated and ineffecient. Joining 
the team taught me a lot about teamwork (and robotics) while also being a lot of fun. I'm really excited for the RoboSub Competition!
