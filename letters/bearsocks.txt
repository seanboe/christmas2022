Hi!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Merry Christmas!

This year has been a lot of fun, in part because of you. It doesnâ€™t really matter what weâ€™re doing - getting food, walking, trying to work, really trying to work - you make it fun, even if youâ€™re sleepy. You're probably the most witty person I know (except for my Dad...) and... I love it. It doesn't matter what you say or who you say it to, you're going to make me laugh! So thanks for that :D .

Iâ€™m really happy Ben dragged me into you (and Mia) - these past few months have easily been my favorite period of high school. 

Oh, and thanks for ordering that chocolate cream cold brew.

Iâ€™m happy weâ€™re friends - Iâ€™m forcing you to be - and I hope we stay friends for a lot longer! Next year is going to be a lot of fun!

Oh, and please have more confidence. You are awesome. Really.

Ps: 'baa baa bitch go fuck yourself.' has got to be my favorite line in the entire world. 

Merry Christmas!
