Merry Christmas Nguyen! Thank you for being a great calculus teacher! I learned a lot during your class, and it was probably the most fun a math class has ever been for me. Also,
thank you for the opportunities you gave me to tutor students outside of school! Oh, and, of course, thank you for your letter of recommendation and putting up with my annoying
questions/requests during wolverine time. I couldn't be happier to have had you as my teacher earlier this year!
