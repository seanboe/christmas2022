Yo! Merry Christmas! The past year has been a lot of fun because of you - from homeroom shenanigans to Team Inspiration. I also can't thank you more for 
allowing me to join the team. It's been really fun, and I've learned at lot (and, albeit regretably, gained a worsened taste in music). Robosub is going to be 
really cool, and I can't wait to have you lead our team to victory.
